# Linux process
## 1. What is Program & Process
### 1.1 Program
Program is a group of instruction that perform a specific task, which can ve performed by exectuable files and located on the computer's hard drive.

### 1.2 Process
Process is a program that is executing and using system resources.

Each process has a code that is used to identify it called Process ID (PID), which is a positive and unique integer for each process on the system.


| **File Type**                                             | **Symbol**                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| The program contains a set of instructions designed to complete a specific task.  |The process is an instance of an executing program.        | 
|A program is a passive entity as it resides in the secondary memory.|The process is an active entity as it is created during execution and loaded into the main memory.|
| Program exists at a single place and continues to exist until it is deleted. |The process exists for a limited period as it gets terminated after the completion of the task.|
| A program is a static entity.|The process is a dynamic entity.| 
| The program does not have any resource requirement, it only requires memory space for storing the instructions.| The process has a high resource requirement, it needs resources like CPU, memory address, and I/O during its lifetime. |
| Stored as a file (.exe, .py, .jar, etc.) Does not consume CPU or RAM until it’s executed| Uses CPU and memory (RAM), Created and managed by the operating system|
|One program can create multiple processes|Each process is independent|

## 1.2 Command line argument
Every program starts from main.
There are two common ways to declare the **main()** function in C.
Type 1:
```sh
int main(void)
```

Type 2:
```sh
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
```

When running the program, the enviroment parameters(commmand line arguments) will be passed as two arguments in the main():
- **argc** (Number of parameters passed to main function.
- **argv[]** (Array of pointers point to the parameters passed to that program.

**Code demo**
```sh
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{   
    int i;

    // In ra số lượng command-line truyền vào.
    printf("Number of arguments: %d\n", argc);    
    
    // In ra nội dung của mỗi command-line.
    for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("argc[%d]: %s\n", i+1, argv[i]);
    }
}
```

**Input**
```sh
./app Linux Messi Khanh
```

**Output** 
```sh
Number of arguments: 4
argc[1]: ./fork
argc[2]: linux
argc[3]: messi
argc[4]: alo
```
