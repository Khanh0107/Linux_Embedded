| The program contains a set of instructions designed to complete a specific task.  |The process is an instance of an executing program.        | 
|A program is a passive entity as it resides in the secondary memory.|The process is an active entity as it is created during execution and loaded into the main memory.|
| Program exists at a single place and continues to exist until it is deleted. |The process exists for a limited period as it gets terminated after the completion of the task.|
| A program is a static entity.|The process is a dynamic entity.| 
| The program does not have any resource requirement, it only requires memory space for storing the instructions.| The process has a high resource requirement, it needs resources like CPU, memory address, and I/O during its lifetime. |
| Stored as a file (.exe, .py, .jar, etc.) Does not consume CPU or RAM until itâ€™s executed| Uses CPU and memory (RAM), Created and managed by the operating system|
|One program can create multiple processes|Each process is independent|
