# Linux process
## 1. What is Program & Process
### 1.1 Program
Program is a group of instruction that perform a specific task, which can ve performed by exectuable files and located on the computer's hard drive.

---
### 1.2 Process
Process is a program that is executing and using system resources.

Each process has a code that is used to identify it called Process ID (PID), which is a positive and unique integer for each process on the system.

---

| **Program**                                             | **Process**                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| The program contains a set of instructions designed to complete a specific task.  |The process is an instance of an executing program.        | 
|A program is a passive entity as it resides in the secondary memory.|The process is an active entity as it is created during execution and loaded into the main memory.|
| Program exists at a single place and continues to exist until it is deleted. |The process exists for a limited period as it gets terminated after the completion of the task.|
| A program is a static entity.|The process is a dynamic entity.| 
| The program does not have any resource requirement, it only requires memory space for storing the instructions.| The process has a high resource requirement, it needs resources like CPU, memory address, and I/O during its lifetime. |
| Stored as a file (.exe, .py, .jar, etc.) Does not consume CPU or RAM until it‚Äôs executed| Uses CPU and memory (RAM), Created and managed by the operating system|
|One program can create multiple processes|Each process is independent|

**Show all process in system**

```sh
ps -aux
```

**Search for running processes related to the term "main**

```sh
ps -aux | grep -iE main
```

---

### 1.3 Relationship Between Programs and Processes
A process is created when a program is loaded into memory and begins execution
Multiple processes can be created from the same program
When a process completes its task, it terminates and releases system resources

---

## 2. Command line argument
Every program starts from main.

There are two common ways to declare the **main()** function in C.

Type 1:
```c
int main(void)
```

Type 2:
```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
```

When running the program, the enviroment parameters(commmand line arguments) will be passed as two arguments in the main():
- **argc** (Number of parameters passed to main function.
- **argv[]** (Array of pointers point to the parameters passed to that program.

**Code demo**
```sh
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{   
    int i;

    // In ra s·ªë l∆∞·ª£ng command-line truy·ªÅn v√†o.
    printf("Number of arguments: %d\n", argc);    
    
    // In ra n·ªôi dung c·ªßa m·ªói command-line.
    for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("argc[%d]: %s\n", i+1, argv[i]);
    }
}
```

**Input**
```sh
./app Linux Messi Khanh
```

**Output** 
```sh
Number of arguments: 4
argc[1]: ./fork
argc[2]: linux
argc[3]: Messi
argc[4]: Khanh
```

üí° **Tip**
Use **strace** to debug
```sh
strace ./app Linux Messi Khanh
```

## 3. Memory layout
The memory allocated for each process is divide into different part. Usually they are called segments (memeory partitions)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19d58eb9-deee-401d-a63c-1c52641f7bc0)

---
### 3.1 Text segment 
Text segment contains the machine language instruction of the program.

This segment has read-only permissions. Typically the lowest address region after the OS-reserved memory

---

### 3.2 Initialized data segment
Initialized data segment includes global variables and static variables that have been explicity initialized.

This segment has read and write permissions

---
### 3.3 Uninitialized data segment
Uninitialized data segment includes global variables and static variables that have been implicity initialized.

This segment has read and write permissions

---
### 3.4 Heap segment 
Heap segment are for automatic memory allocation. Use functions like alloc(), malloc(), calloc()

The endpoint of the Heap is called a program break

This segment has read and write permissions

---

### 3.5 Stack segment 
Stack can be extending by allocating or freeing stack frames.

This segment has read and write permissions

üí° **How to check when memory leak**

Valgrind is a dynamic analysis tool primarily used for: detecting memory errors, debugging memory leaks, finding undefined behavior in C/C++ programs

**Example check memory leak**

```sh
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    // forget to free(ptr)
    return 0;
}
```

**Compile and run**
```sh
gcc -c main.c -o app

valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes --verbose --log-file=valgrind-out.txt ./app 
cat valgrind-out.txt
```

## 4. Operation on process

### 4.1 System call `fork()`

The `fork()` system call is used in Unix/Linux to create a new process by duplicating the current process.

When fork() is called:

- A new process is created (called the child).

- The child is an almost exact copy of the parent process:

    - Same code, data, heap, stack (initially)

    - But with a different PID
 
**Return Values**

The fork() system call returns different values depending on whether it's the parent or child process:

- In the parent process: Returns the child's Process ID (PID)
  
- In the child process: Returns 0
  
- On failure: Returns -1

**Code demo**

```sh
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])   /* C√¢ÃÅp phaÃÅt stack frame cho haÃÄm main() */
{
    /* code */
    pid_t child_pid;                /* L∆∞u trong stack frame cuÃâa main() */
    int counter = 2;                /* L∆∞u trong frame cuÃâa main() */

    printf("Gia tri khoi tao cua counter: %d\n", counter);

    child_pid = fork();         
    if (child_pid >= 0) {
        if (0 == child_pid) {       /* Process con */
            printf("\nIm the child process, counter: %d\n", ++counter);
            printf("My PID is: %d, my parent PID is: %d\n", getpid(), getppid());
            
        } else {                    /* Process cha */
            printf("\nIm the parent process, counter: %d\n", ++counter);
            printf("My PID is: %d\n", getpid());
	    while (1);
        }
    } else {
        printf("fork() unsuccessfully\n");      // fork() return -1 n·∫øu l·ªói.
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```sh
Gia tri khoi tao cua counter: 0

Im the parrent process, counter: 1
My PID is: 32089, my parrent PID is: 6557

Im the child process, counter: 0
My PID is: 32090, my parrent PID is: 32089
 ```

### 4.2 Exec family 
In many cases you have to run process A and you want to run some program B from process A or its children. This is entirely possible through the use of a list of executable line functions. t‚Äôs commonly used after `fork()`

**List of exec family**

```c
# include <unistd.h>
int execl(const char *pathname, const char *arg, ..., NULL)
int execlp(const char *file, const char *arg, ..., NULL)
int execle(const char *pathname, const char *arg, ..., NULL, char *const envp[])
int execv(const char *pathname, char *const argv[])
int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[])
```


|**Function** | **Description**|
|-------------------|-------------------|
|`execl` |Pass arguments one by one (`execl(path, arg0, arg1, ..., NULL)`)|
|`execlp` |	Like `execl`, but searches the executable in `$PATH`|
|`execle` |Like `execl`, but lets you specify environment (`envp[]`)|
|`execv` |	Pass arguments as array (`execv(path, argv[])`)|
|`execvp` |	Like `execv`, but searches in `$PATH`|

**Example `execl`**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{    
    printf("Run command <ls -lah> after 2 seconds\n");
    sleep(2);
    execl("/bin/ls", "ls", "-l", "-a", "-h", NULL);
    return 0;   
}
```

**Note**

The `which` command in Linux is used to locate the full path of an executable command.

**Example**

``` sh
which ls
output
/bin/ls
```

---
### 4.3 Process termination 
**Normally termination**

Normally, a process can complete its execution by calling the system call `_exit()` or using the `exit()` function. Occurs when the process finishes as expected

**Abnormally termination**

Abnormally, a process can be killed by using system call kill() or kill command in Linux. Occurs when the process is forced to stop unexpectedly due to an error or signal.

## 5. Process management

One of the programming philosophies is "do one thing and do it well"

The process management is basically implemmented using a number of system calls. These system calls can be combined to perform more complex problems
- `fork()`
- `exit()`
- `wait()`

![Process_management](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4ad2f81-b2eb-45a2-99c3-d868a257165b)

**Code demo**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])   /* C√¢ÃÅp phaÃÅt stack frame cho haÃÄm main() */
{
    /* code */
    pid_t child_pid;                /* L∆∞u trong stack frame cuÃâa main() */
    int status, ret;
    int retVal;
    ret = fork();         
    if (ret == 0)
    {
            /* Process con */
        printf("Im the child process, my PID: %d\n", getpid());
        printf("Child process terminate after 5 seconds\n");
	    sleep(5);
	    exit(0);
    } 
    else if(ret > 0)   
    {                  /* Process cha */
        retVal = wait(&status);
        if (retVal == -1) 
        {
            printf("wait() unsuccessful\n");
        }
            printf("\nIm the parent process, PID child process: %d\n", retVal);   
        if (WIFEXITED(status))
        {
               printf("Normally termination, status = %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
        } 
        else if (WIFSIGNALED(status)) 
        {
               printf("killed by signal, value = %d\n", WTERMSIG(status));
        } 
        
    } 
    else 
    {
        printf("fork() unsuccessfully\n");      // fork() return -1 n·∫øu l·ªói.
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```sh
Im the child process, my PID: 3101
Child process terminate after 5 seconds

Im the parent process, PID child process: 3101
Normally termination, status = 0
```

### 5.1 System call `wait`

The `wait()` system call is used to monitor the termination status of one the child process created by the parent process.
- At the time `wait()` is called, it will block until a child process terminates. If there exits a child processthat has terminated before the time of calling `wait()`, it will return immediately.
- If the status is other than -1, status argument will point to a value that is an integer, which is information about the end state of the process
- When `wait()` is finished, it wll return the PID of the child process or return -1 if it fails

#### fork()
- Creates a new process (child) from the calling process (parent).
- Returns:
  - `0` to the child process.
  - Child's **PID** to the parent process.
  - `-1` if process creation failed.

#### exit()
- Terminates the calling process.
- Returns an **exit status** to the parent process.
- Ensures that the resources are properly released.

#### wait()
- Used to monitor the termination status of one of the child processes created by the parent process.
- Blocks the parent process until a child process terminates.  
  - If a child process has already terminated, it returns immediately.
- If the `status` is other than **-1**, it points to an integer value containing information about the child's termination state.
- Returns the **PID of the terminated child process** or **-1** if an error occurs.
```c
#include <sys/wait.h>


pid_t wait(int *status);
```

#### waitpid()
- Addresses the limitation of `wait()` when there are multiple child processes.  
- Allows the parent process to wait for a **specific child process** to terminate.  
- Can be set to **non-blocking mode** using the `WNOHANG` option.  
- Returns the **PID of the terminated child process** or **-1** if an error occurs.

#### Syntax
```c
#include <sys/wait.h>

pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);
```
- `pid`:
  - `> 0`: PID of the specific child process to wait for.
  - `= 0`: Wait for any child process in the same process group.
  - `< -1`: Wait for any child process whose process group ID is the absolute value of `pid`.
  - `= -1`: Wait for any child process (similar to `wait()`).
- `status`: Points to an integer where the termination status will be stored.
- `options`: Additional options to modify behavior (e.g., `WNOHANG` for non-blocking wait).

## 6. Orphan and Zombie process
### 6.1 Orphan process
Definition: An orphan process is a still-running child process whose parent has terminated.

What Happens: When the parent dies, the child is adopted by the init process (in modern Linux systems, usually systemd), which will eventually clean it up properly.

Key Point: Orphans are not dangerous ‚Äî they're re-parented and managed.

---

### 6.2 Zombie process
Definition: A zombie process is a process that has completed execution (i.e., it‚Äôs dead), but still has an entry in the process table.

Reason: This happens when the parent process hasn‚Äôt read the child‚Äôs exit status using wait() or waitpid() ‚Äî so the system keeps the child's process entry so the parent can still collect that status.

Key Point: It's a "dead" process that's not yet fully cleaned up.
