# Shared memory

## 1. What is shared memory

Shared memory is a memory area that allows multiple processes to access it at the same time.

Increases processing speed when processes do not need to send and receive data to each other.

After being created, the program's virtual memory area will be located in the address space between the head memory area and the stack memory area.

When one process writes data to the shared memory region, other processes with access to this region can immediately see the changes **without any system calls to copy data**.

There are two main API standards for working with shared memory on Unix-like systems:

  1. System V Shared Memory: An older standard, part of the System V IPC suite. Uses functions like shmget, shmat, shmdt, shmctl.
  2. POSIX Shared Memory: A newer, more flexible standard. Uses functions like shm_open, ftruncate, mmap, munmap, shm_unlink.

## 2. Why Use Shared Memory?

Shared Memory is the preferred IPC mechanism when data exchange speed is critical.

- **Superior Speed**: It is the fastest IPC method for transferring large amounts of data between processes. Since processes access the same physical memory directly, data doesn't need to be copied.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimizes CPU and memory overhead associated with data copying.
- **Flexibility**: Allows complex data structures to be built directly in the shared memory region for multiple processes to use.
  
However, Shared Memory also has drawbacks:

- **Complex Synchronization**: Shared Memory does not provide built-in synchronization mechanisms. Processes must manage concurrent access using other IPC tools like Semaphores or -  Mutexes to avoid race conditions.
- **Management**: Careful management of shared memory objects is required to prevent resource leaks.

## 3. System V Shared Memory

System V Shared Memory manages memory regions using system-wide unique integer identifiers.

**Key Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create or Get Key:** Use `ftok()` to generate a unique `key_t` based on a file path and project ID.
2. **Create or Get Segment ID:** Use `shmget()` with the key to request a new shared memory segment or get an existing one.
3. **Attach Segment:** Use `shmat()` to map the segment into the process's address space.
4. **Use Segment:** Read/write data using the pointer from `shmat()`. **(External synchronization required!)**
5. **Detach Segment:** Use `shmdt()` to unmap the segment from the process's address space.
6. **Control and Release Segment:** Use `shmctl()` with commands like `IPC_RMID` to remove the segment.

### 3.1. Create Key (`ftok`)

The `ftok()` function generates a key based on a file path and project ID. Different processes can generate the same key if they use identical parameters.

```c
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

key_t ftok(const char *pathname, int proj_id);
// Returns key_t on success, (key_t)-1 on error.
```

* `pathname`: Path to an existing file
* `proj_id`: A non-zero integer (typically uses only the least significant 8 bits)

### 3.2. Create/Get Shared Memory Segment (`shmget`)

The `shmget()` function creates a new segment or gets the ID of an existing one.

```c
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);
// Returns shmid (segment identifier) on success, -1 on error.
```

* `key`: The `key_t` from `ftok()` or `IPC_PRIVATE` for private segments.
* `size`: The size (in bytes) of the segment. Can be 0 when getting an existing segment.
* `shmflg`: Control flags and access permissions:
  * `IPC_CREAT`: Create the segment if it doesn't exist.
  * `IPC_EXCL`: Used with `IPC_CREAT`, fails if the segment already exists.
  * Access Permissions (e.g., `0666` for read/write by user, group, others):

### 3.3. Attach/Detach Shared Memory Segment (`shmat`, `shmdt`)

`shmat()` maps the segment into the process's address space, and `shmdt()` unmaps it.

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

void *shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int shmflg);
// Returns pointer to memory region on success, (void *)-1 on error.

int shmdt(const void *shmaddr);
// Returns 0 on success, -1 on error.
```

* `shmid`: Segment ID from `shmget()`.
* `shmaddr` (for `shmat`): Suggested address. Usually `NULL` to let the system choose.
* `shmflg` (for `shmat`): Flags like `SHM_RDONLY` for read-only access.
* `shmaddr` (for `shmdt`): The pointer returned by `shmat()`.

Note that `shmdt()` only detaches the segment from the current process; it doesn't remove it from the system.

### 3.4. Control and Release Shared Memory Segment (`shmctl`)

`shmctl()` performs control operations on segments.

```c
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

int shmctl(int shmid, int cmd, struct shmid_ds *buf);
// Returns 0 on success, -1 on error.
```

* `shmid`: Segment ID.
* `cmd`: Command to execute:
  * `IPC_STAT`: Get segment information, stored in `buf`.
  * `IPC_SET`: Set permissions and attributes from `buf`.
  * `IPC_RMID`: Mark the segment for removal when all processes detach.
* `buf`: Pointer to a `shmid_ds` structure for information (can be NULL for `IPC_RMID`).

```c
// Structure containing segment information 
struct shmid_ds {
    struct ipc_perm shm_perm;  /* Access permissions (owner, group, mode) */
    size_t          shm_segsz; /* Size of segment (bytes) */
    pid_t           shm_lpid;  /* PID of last process performing operation */
    pid_t           shm_cpid;  /* PID of creator */
    shmatt_t        shm_nattch;/* Number of current attaches */
    time_t          shm_atime; /* Last attach time */
    time_t          shm_dtime; /* Last detach time */
    time_t          shm_ctime; /* Last change time */
    // ...
};

// Structure for permissions
struct ipc_perm {
    uid_t    uid;    /* Owner's user ID */
    gid_t    gid;    /* Owner's group ID */
    uid_t    cuid;   /* Creator's user ID */
    gid_t    cgid;   /* Creator's group ID */
    mode_t   mode;   /* Access modes */
    // ...
};
```

### 3.5. System V Shared Memory Example

**shm_writer_sysv.c (Writing Process):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h> // For sleep

#define SHM_SIZE 1024       // Shared memory size
#define SHM_KEY_PATH "/tmp" // File path for ftok
#define SHM_KEY_ID 'A'      // Project ID for ftok

int main() {
    key_t key;
    int shmid;
    char *shm_ptr;
    char *data_to_write = "Hello from System V Writer!";

    // 1. Create key
    key = ftok(SHM_KEY_PATH, SHM_KEY_ID);
    if (key == -1) {
        perror("ftok");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Writer: Generated key: %d\n", key);

    // 2. Create segment (or get if exists)
    // Create new with 0666 permissions (read/write for everyone)
    shmid = shmget(key, SHM_SIZE, IPC_CREAT | 0666);
    if (shmid == -1) {
        perror("shmget");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Writer: Shared memory segment created/obtained. ID: %d\n", shmid);

    // 3. Attach segment to address space
    shm_ptr = (char *)shmat(shmid, NULL, 0);
    if (shm_ptr == (void *)-1) {
        perror("shmat");
        // Consider removing segment if creator and attach failed
        shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Writer: Shared memory attached at address: %p\n", shm_ptr);

    // 4. Write data to shared memory
    printf("Writer: Writing data: \"%s\"\n", data_to_write);
    strncpy(shm_ptr, data_to_write, SHM_SIZE - 1);
    shm_ptr[SHM_SIZE - 1] = '\0'; // Ensure null-termination

    // Wait a bit for the reader (real applications need proper synchronization)
    printf("Writer: Data written. Waiting for reader...\n");
    sleep(10); // Wait 10 seconds

    // 5. Detach segment
    if (shmdt(shm_ptr) == -1) {
        perror("shmdt");
        // Still try to remove the segment
        shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Writer: Shared memory detached.\n");

    // 6. Mark segment for removal (if you are the last one, it will be removed)
    // Typically, a "server" or manager process does this
    // after knowing no one else needs it. In this simple example, the writer removes it.
    if (shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL) == -1) {
        perror("shmctl(IPC_RMID)");
        // exit(EXIT_FAILURE); // Not strictly necessary to exit on removal error
    }
    printf("Writer: Marked segment for removal.\n");

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

**shm_reader_sysv.c (Reading Process):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h> // For sleep

#define SHM_SIZE 1024
#define SHM_KEY_PATH "/tmp"
#define SHM_KEY_ID 'A'

int main() {
    key_t key;
    int shmid;
    char *shm_ptr;

    // 1. Generate the key (must be identical to writer)
    key = ftok(SHM_KEY_PATH, SHM_KEY_ID);
    if (key == -1) {
        perror("ftok");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Reader: Generated key: %d\n", key);

    // 2. Get the ID of the segment created by the writer
    // When just getting the ID, size must match or be 0
    shmid = shmget(key, SHM_SIZE, 0666);
    if (shmid == -1) {
        perror("shmget (Reader might start before writer? Check key/perms)");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Reader: Shared memory segment ID: %d\n", shmid);

    // 3. Attach the segment
    shm_ptr = (char *)shmat(shmid, NULL, 0); // Attach for read/write
    if (shm_ptr == (void *)-1) {
        perror("shmat");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Reader: Shared memory attached at address: %p\n", shm_ptr);

    // 4. Read data from shared memory
    printf("Reader: Waiting a bit before reading...\n");
    sleep(1); // Wait for writer (needs better synchronization)
    printf("Reader: Data read from shared memory: \"%s\"\n", shm_ptr);

    // 5. Detach the segment
    if (shmdt(shm_ptr) == -1) {
        perror("shmdt");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Reader: Shared memory detached.\n");

    // The reader usually doesn't call IPC_RMID. Removal is handled
    // by the writer or a dedicated manager process.

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

**Improved Synchronization Example**

While the above examples work for demonstration, real-world applications need proper synchronization. Here's an example using a simple flag in shared memory:

```c
// Structure for shared data with synchronization
struct shared_data {
    int ready_flag;        // 0 = not ready, 1 = data ready, 2 = data read
    char message[1020];    // Actual data (adjusted for struct alignment)
};

// In writer:
struct shared_data *data = (struct shared_data *)shm_ptr;
data->ready_flag = 0;  // Initialize as not ready
strcpy(data->message, "Hello with synchronization!");
data->ready_flag = 1;  // Signal data is ready
printf("Writer: Data ready, waiting for reader to process...\n");

// Wait for reader to signal data was read
while (data->ready_flag != 2) {
    usleep(10000);  // Sleep for 10ms to reduce CPU usage
}
printf("Writer: Reader has processed the data.\n");

// In reader:
struct shared_data *data = (struct shared_data *)shm_ptr;
// Wait for data to be ready
while (data->ready_flag != 1) {
    usleep(10000);  // Sleep for 10ms
}
printf("Reader: Data received: \"%s\"\n", data->message);
data->ready_flag = 2;  // Signal data was read
```
