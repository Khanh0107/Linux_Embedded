# Shared memory

## 1. What is shared memory

Shared memory is a memory area that allows multiple processes to access it at the same time.

Increases processing speed when processes do not need to send and receive data to each other.

After being created, the program's virtual memory area will be located in the address space between the head memory area and the stack memory area.

When one process writes data to the shared memory region, other processes with access to this region can immediately see the changes **without any system calls to copy data**.

There are two main API standards for working with shared memory on Unix-like systems:

  1. System V Shared Memory: An older standard, part of the System V IPC suite. Uses functions like shmget, shmat, shmdt, shmctl.
  2. POSIX Shared Memory: A newer, more flexible standard. Uses functions like shm_open, ftruncate, mmap, munmap, shm_unlink.
