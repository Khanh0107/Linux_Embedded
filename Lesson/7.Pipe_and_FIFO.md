# Pipe and FIFO

## 1. Pipe

### 1.1 Defition 

A pipe is a unidirectional communication channel. It lets one process write data to it, and another read that data.

- It's one-way: if Process A writes, Process B reads.
- If two-way communication is needed, two pipes are required.

---

### 1.2 Operating principle

When a pipe is created, it resides in RAM and is considered a "virtual file". 

Pipes can be used during process creation.

When a process writes to a "virtual file" (or pipe), another related-process can read data from it.

**Reading from a pipe:**

- If an attempt is made to read data from an "empty" pipe, the read head will block until it has read at least 1 byte.
- If the write head of a pipe is closed, the read head will re-read all remaining data in the pipe and return 0.
  
**Pipes have a limited capacity:**

- A pipe is simply a buffer maintained in memory.
- This buffer has a maximum capacity. When a pipe is full, the write head can only write data to the pipe when the read head takes some data from the pipe.

## 2. Working with `pipe`

### 2.1. Create `pipe`

If we create the pipe before calling fork(). Then parent and child (related-process) can communicate through the pipe.

`int pipe(int fd[2]);`

fd is an array of two integers: fd[0] and fd[1]

- fd[0] → read end of the pipe
- fd[1] → write end of the pipe

| Return | Meaning                       |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| `0`    | Success, file descriptors set |
| `-1`   | Error, `errno` is set         |

**Example code**

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>

#define MSG_SIZE    20

char *msg1 = "hello, world #1";
char *msg2 = "hello, world #2";
char *msg3 = "hello, world #3";
char *msg4 = "hello, world #4";

char pipe_buff[MSG_SIZE];
int fds[2], i;

void sig_handler1(int num)
{
	printf("Im signal handler1: %d\n", num);
	write(fds[1], msg4, MSG_SIZE);
}

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    /* code */

    if (signal(SIGINT, sig_handler1) == SIG_ERR) {
   	 	fprintf(stderr, "Cannot handle SIGINT\n");
   	 	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    if (pipe(fds) < 0) {
        printf("pipe() unsuccessfully\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    //write(fds[1], msg1, MSG_SIZE);
    //write(fds[1], msg2, MSG_SIZE);
    //write(fds[1], msg3, MSG_SIZE); 
    //printf("sleep 2 seconds\n");
    //sleep(2);

    read(fds[0], pipe_buff, MSG_SIZE);
    printf("msg[%d]: %s\n", 1, pipe_buff);

    //for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    //    read(fds[0], pipe_buff, MSG_SIZE);
    //    printf("msg[%d]: %s\n", i+1, pipe_buff);
    //}

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```sh
sleep 2 seconds
msg[1]: hello, world #1
msg[2]: hello, world #2
msg[3]: hello, world #3
```

### 2.2 Two-way communication

To achieve two-way communication, simply create two pipes to send data in each direction between two processes.

When using this technique, care must be taken to avoid issues like deadlock, such as when a process attempts to read from an empty pipe or write to a full pipe.

**Parent as Writer, Child as Reader:**

- Parent Process writes data to the pipe via the write end of pipe.
- Child Process reads data from the pipe via the read end of pipe.
- The Parent closes the read end, and the Child closes the write end to ensure one-way communication.

**Parent as Reader, Child as Writer:**

- Parent Process reads data from the pipe via the read end of pipe.
- Child Process writes data to the pipe via the write end of pipe.
- The Parent closes the write end, and the Child closes the read end to ensure one-way communication.

## 3. FIFO - name pipes

### 3.1 Defintion 

This is an extension of pipes. Traditional pipes are unnamed and exist only for the lifetime of the process.

The main difference is that FIFOs have a name in the file system and are opened like a normal file.

Named Pipes can exist as long as the system is running. Beyond the lifetime of the process. Can be deleted if no longer needed.

A FIFO file is a special file stored in local memory. It is created by the `mkfifo()` function in C.

### 3.2 Working with FIFO

#### 3.2.1 Create FIFO by shell


Command: mkfifo [-m mode] pathname

I.E: `mkfifo -m 0666 ./helloFIFO`

#### 3.2.2 Create FIFO by source code

`mkfifo()` is a system call in Unix/Linux used to create a FIFO special file, also known as a named pipe. It creates an actual file in the filesystem that acts as a communication channel between processes.

`int mkfifo(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);`

| Parameter  | Description                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pathname` | Name of the FIFO to be created (e.g., `"myfifo"`)             |
| `mode`     | File permission bits (e.g., `0666` = read/write for everyone) |

| Return Value | Meaning                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| `0`          | Success                   |
| `-1`         | Failure, and sets `errno` |

**Difference: pipe() vs FIFO**

| Aspect        | `pipe()` (anonymous pipe)                         | `FIFO` (named pipe)                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Visible in FS | ❌ No                                              | ✅ Yes (special file)                   |
| Scope         | Parent-child only                                 | Any processes (if they open same FIFO) |
| Direction     | One-way per FIFO                                  | One-way per FIFO                       |
| Creation      | `pipe(fd)`                                        | `mkfifo()` or `mknod()`                |
| Usage         | File operations (`read()`, `write()` on filename) |                                        |

**Example code**

**producer.c**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define FIFO_FILE   "./myfifo"
#define BUFF_SIZE   1024

int main() {
    char buff[BUFF_SIZE];
    int fd;

    // Tạo FIFO nếu chưa tồn tại
    if (mkfifo(FIFO_FILE, 0666) == -1) {
        // Không cần thoát nếu đã tồn tại
        perror("mkfifo (provider)");
    }

    while (1) {
        printf("Message to consumer: ");
        fflush(stdout);   // Đảm bảo dòng hiển thị ngay

        fgets(buff, BUFF_SIZE, stdin);

        fd = open(FIFO_FILE, O_WRONLY);
        if (fd == -1) {
            perror("open (provider)");
            continue;
        }

        // Ghi dữ liệu và đóng FIFO
        write(fd, buff, strlen(buff));  // Không cần +1 vì không bắt buộc có \0
        close(fd);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**consumer.c**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define FIFO_FILE   "./myfifo"
#define BUFF_SIZE   1024

int main() {
    char buff[BUFF_SIZE];
    int fd;

    // Tạo FIFO nếu chưa tồn tại
    if (mkfifo(FIFO_FILE, 0666) == -1) {
        perror("mkfifo (consumer)");
    }

    while (1) {
        fd = open(FIFO_FILE, O_RDONLY);
        if (fd == -1) {
            perror("open (consumer)");
            continue;
        }

        ssize_t bytes = read(fd, buff, BUFF_SIZE - 1);
        if (bytes > 0) {
            buff[bytes] = '\0';  // Đảm bảo chuỗi kết thúc
            printf("Producer message: %s", buff);
            fflush(stdout);
        }

        close(fd);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## 4. 4. Building a Client-Server Model with FIFOs

**Problem: Building a Client-Server Model Using FIFOs**

- S1: Establishing a Connection
  
  - How do clients know about the server?
  - Well-known address/name:
    - Fixed location.
  - Server Identification:
    - Provides multiple services.
    - Clients must request to register.
    - Adds overhead (cost, programming).
    
- S2: Handling Connection Requests
Server:

Creates a FIFO to handle requests.
Processes the request message:
Check the key.
Check the service.
Send a connection limit.
Sends an acknowledgment (accept/reject) for the request.
Client:

Creates a FIFO to send and receive messages:
Name = TEMPLATE + PID.
Closes the request message:
Name.
Requested service.
Key.
Sends the request to the server:
If the server accepts → Sends the data branch.
If the server rejects → Destroys the FIFO.
Note: Multiple clients may send requests, so a single FIFO cannot be used to handle all requests.
