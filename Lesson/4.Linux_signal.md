# Linux signal 
## 1. Introduction
In Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems), signals are a form of inter-process communication (IPC) used to notify a process that a specific event has occurred.

Signals are simple and asynchronous, making them a lightweight mechanism for handling events such as interruptions, exceptions, or user-defined triggers

**What is a Signal?**

A signal is essentially a message sent to a process to inform it of an event. 

The kernel or another process can send a signal, and the receiving process can then take appropriate action — such as handling the signal, ignoring it, or terminating.

**Phases of the Signal Life Cycle**
---
**1.1 Signal Generation**
- A signal is generated when an event occurs that is associated with a specific signal number.
- User actions: e.g., `Ctrl+C` sends `SIGINT`, `kill -9 PID` sends `SIGKILL`.
- APIs:
  - `kill(pid, signum)` – sends a signal to a process.
  - `raise(signum)` – sends a signal to the calling process.
  - `sigqueue(pid, signum, union sigval)` – sends a signal with accompanying data (used for real-time signals).

**1.2 Signal Delivery**
- Signal delivery happens when ,he process is executing (i.e., it's scheduled on the CPU) and the signal is not blocked.

**1.3 Signal Delivery**
Signal processing refers to how a Linux process responds to signals sent by the system, the user, or other processes.
Once a signal is delivered, the process must choose how to respond, and there are three main options:
