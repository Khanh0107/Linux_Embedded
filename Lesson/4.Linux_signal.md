# Linux signal 
## 1. Introduction
In Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems), signals are a form of inter-process communication (IPC) used to notify a process that a specific event has occurred.

Signals are simple and asynchronous, making them a lightweight mechanism for handling events such as interruptions, exceptions, or user-defined triggers

**What is a Signal?**

A signal is essentially a message sent to a process to inform it of an event. 

The kernel or another process can send a signal, and the receiving process can then take appropriate action — such as handling the signal, ignoring it, or terminating.

**Phases of the Signal Life Cycle**

### 1.1 Signal Generation**
- A signal is generated when an event occurs that is associated with a specific signal number.
- User actions: e.g., `Ctrl+C` sends `SIGINT`, `kill -9 PID` sends `SIGKILL`.
- APIs:
  - `kill(pid, signum)` – sends a signal to a process.
  - `raise(signum)` – sends a signal to the calling process.
  - `sigqueue(pid, signum, union sigval)` – sends a signal with accompanying data (used for real-time signals).

### 1.2 Signal Delivery**
- Signal delivery happens when ,he process is executing (i.e., it's scheduled on the CPU) and the signal is not blocked.

### 1.3 Signal Processing**

Signal processing refers to how a Linux process responds to signals sent by the system, the user, or other processes.

Once a signal is delivered, the process must choose how to respond, and there are three main options:

#### 1.3.1 Ignore the signal**

The process simply discards the signal without taking any action.

**Code**

```c
#include <signal.h>

int main() {
    signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN);  // Ignore Ctrl+C (SIGINT)
    while (1);                // Infinite loop
    return 0;
}
```

⚠️ Some signals cannot be ignored:

`SIGKILL (9)
SIGSTOP (19)`

These are handled directly by the kernel and cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.

#### 1.3.2 Catch and Handle the Signal**

Kernel temporarily suspends the main thread and transfers control to the signal handler (SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught)

#### 1.3.3 Perform the default action**

Each signal has its own default action (terminate, stop, continue, or ignore)
