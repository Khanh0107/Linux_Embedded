# Linux signal 
## 1. Introduction
In Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems), signals are a form of inter-process communication (IPC) used to notify a process that a specific event has occurred.

Signals are simple and asynchronous, making them a lightweight mechanism for handling events such as interruptions, exceptions, or user-defined triggers

**What is a Signal?**

A signal is essentially a message sent to a process to inform it of an event. 

The kernel or another process can send a signal, and the receiving process can then take appropriate action â€” such as handling the signal, ignoring it, or terminating.
