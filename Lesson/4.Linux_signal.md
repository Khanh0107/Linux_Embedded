# Linux signal 
## 1. Introduction
In Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems), signals are a form of inter-process communication (IPC) used to notify a process that a specific event has occurred.

Signals are simple and asynchronous, making them a lightweight mechanism for handling events such as interruptions, exceptions, or user-defined triggers

**What is a Signal?**

A signal is essentially a message sent to a process to inform it of an event. 

The kernel or another process can send a signal, and the receiving process can then take appropriate action ‚Äî such as handling the signal, ignoring it, or terminating.

**Phases of the Signal Life Cycle**

---
### 1.1 Signal Generation
- A signal is generated when an event occurs that is associated with a specific signal number.
- User actions: e.g., `Ctrl+C` sends `SIGINT`, `kill -9 PID` sends `SIGKILL`.
- APIs:
  - `kill(pid, signum)` ‚Äì sends a signal to a process.
  - `raise(signum)` ‚Äì sends a signal to the calling process.
  - `sigqueue(pid, signum, union sigval)` ‚Äì sends a signal with accompanying data (used for real-time signals).

---
### 1.2 Signal Delivery
- Signal delivery happens when ,he process is executing (i.e., it's scheduled on the CPU) and the signal is not blocked.

---

### 1.3 Signal Processing

Signal processing refers to how a Linux process responds to signals sent by the system, the user, or other processes.

Once a signal is delivered, the process must choose how to respond, and there are three main options:

#### 1.3.1 Ignore the signal**

The process simply discards the signal without taking any action.

**Code**

```c
#include <signal.h>

int main() {
    signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN);  // Ignore Ctrl+C (SIGINT)
    while (1);                // Infinite loop
    return 0;
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Some signals cannot be ignored:**

`SIGKILL (9)`

`SIGSTOP (19)`

These are handled directly by the kernel and cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.

--- 

#### 1.3.2 Catch and Handle the Signal

Kernel temporarily suspends the main thread and transfers control to the signal handler (SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught)

---

#### 1.3.3 Perform the default action

Each signal has its own default action (terminate, stop, continue, or ignore)

---

## 2. Signal Handler

The `signal()` system call in Linux is used to set a handler function for a specific signal. When that signal is received, the kernel will invoke the handler function instead of performing the default action

üìò Function Prototype

```c
#include <signal.h>
void (*signal(int signum, void (*handler)(int)))(int);
```

üìå Parameters

`signum` : The signal number to handle (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM)

`handler` : 	A pointer to the handler function, or`SIG_IGN`: Ignore the signal, `SIG_DFL`: Use the default action or A custom function like `void handler(int)`

**Code demo**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>

void sig_handler(int num)
{
    printf("Hello world %d\n",num);
}

void sig_handler2(int num)
{
    printf("I'm signal handler2: %d\n",num);
}

void sig_handler3(int num)
{
    printf("I'm signal handler3: %d\n",num);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

int main()   
{
    if (signal(SIGINT, sig_handler) == SIG_ERR)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Can not handle SIGINT\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    signal(SIGKILL, sig_handler2);
    signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler3);
    printf("process ID: %d\n", getpid());

    while(1);
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
kill -l
```

The command kill -l  is used to list all available signals supported by your system, along with their corresponding signal numbers.

## 3. Some basic signals

| **Signal** | **Number** | **Default Action**    | **Can Be Caught or Ignored?** | **Description / Usage**                                      |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SIGKILL`  | 9          | Terminate (immediate) | ‚ùå No                          | Forces process termination; cannot be blocked or handled.    |
| `SIGTERM`  | 15         | Terminate             | ‚úÖ Yes                         | Requests graceful termination; can be handled or ignored.    |
| `SIGINT`   | 2          | Terminate             | ‚úÖ Yes                         | Sent when user presses `Ctrl+C`; used to interrupt process.  |
| `SIGCHLD`  | 17 (Linux) | Ignore                | ‚úÖ Yes                         | Sent to parent when a child process ends or stops.           |
| `SIGSTOP`  | 19         | Stop (pause)          | ‚ùå No                          | Suspends the process; cannot be caught or ignored.           |
| `SIGUSR1`  | 10         | Terminate             | ‚úÖ Yes                         | User-defined signal 1; used for custom application behavior. |
| `SIGUSR2`  | 12         | Terminate             | ‚úÖ Yes                         | User-defined signal 2; same as above, different ID.          |

## 4. Sending signal
The `kill()` system call is used to send a signal to a process or group of processes. Despite the name, it's not only for "killing" processes ‚Äî it's a general-purpose tool for sending any signal.


üìò Function Prototype

```c
#include <signal.h>

int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);
```

üß© Parameters
| Parameter | Type    | Description                                                         |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pid`     | `pid_t` | Target process or group (see special cases below)                   |
| `sig`     | `int`   | Signal number to send (e.g., `SIGKILL`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGUSR1`, etc.) |

üì• Return Value

0 on success.

-1 on error, and errno is set to indicate the error type.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

```c
kill(1234, SIGTERM);  // Send SIGTERM to process with PID 1234
kill(getpid(), SIGINT);  // Send SIGINT to current process
```

## 5. Blocking and unbocking signal

Signal blocking is a mechanism that allows a process (or thread) to temporarily prevent specific signals from being delivered while it is executing critical code.

Instead of being delivered immediately, blocked signals are put on hold (pending) until they are unblocked.

üß© **Why Block Signals?**

To avoid interruptions during critical sections (e.g., file writing, memory operations).

To ensure atomic operations aren‚Äôt disturbed.

To temporarily delay handling signals (until it‚Äôs safe to process them).

‚öôÔ∏è System Calls for Signal Blocking

| Function        | Purpose                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `sigprocmask()` | Modify the signal mask (block/unblock)        |
| `sigpending()`  | View which signals are currently pending      |
| `sigismember()` | Check if a specific signal is in a signal set |
| `sigaddset()`   | Add signal to a signal set                    |
| `sigdelset()`   | Remove signal from a signal set               |
| `sigemptyset()` | Initialize an empty signal set                |
| `sigfillset()`  | Initialize a full signal set (all signals)    |

Example: Blocking and Unblocking `SIGINT`

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    sigset_t new_mask, old_mask;

    // Step 1: Initialize new_mask with SIGINT
    sigemptyset(&new_mask);
    sigaddset(&new_mask, SIGINT);

    // Step 2: Block SIGINT and save the old mask
    sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &new_mask, &old_mask);
    printf("SIGINT is now blocked. Try pressing Ctrl+C\n");

    sleep(5);  // SIGINT will not interrupt this section

    // Step 3: Unblock SIGINT
    sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &old_mask, NULL);
    printf("SIGINT is unblocked. Ctrl+C will now terminate the program.\n");

    while (1);  // Wait to test Ctrl+C
    return 0;
}
```
