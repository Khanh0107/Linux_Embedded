# Message Queue

## 1. Overview

A message queue is a communication method used in inter-process communication (IPC) or distributed systems that allows independent processes, threads, or systems to send and receive messages asynchronously.

A Message Queue is a linked-list of messages maintained by the kernel.

All processes can exchange data by accessing the same queues.

Each message is accompanied by additional information about the message type.

Based on the message type, processes can retrieve the appropriate message.
