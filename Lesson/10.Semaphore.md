# Semaphore

## 1 Introduction 

### 1.1 What is semaphore
Semaphore is a mechanism that allows synchronization of access between processes and threads.

Its main purpose is to block processes and threads from accessing a shared memory area that is being used by another process/thread.

There are 2 types of semaphore that are mainly used:
  - System V semaphore
  - POSIX semaphore

## 1.2 Semaphore type

Defined by SUSv3, POSIX semaphores come in two types:

**Named Semaphores:**

These are semaphores that have a name and are created or opened using the sem_open() function. They can be accessed by unrelated processes, allowing multiple processes to synchronize using the same named semaphore.

**Unnamed Semaphores:**

These semaphores do not have a name, so they cannot be shared using a global identifier. To be used across processes or threads, they must be placed in a shared memory region (such as one created with `mmap()`, or stored in a global/shared variable).

POSIX semaphores are used to coordinate access between processes or threads.

For processes, the semaphore must be stored in a shared memory region (using System V shared memory or POSIX `mmap())`.

For threads, the semaphore should be stored in a shared memory area internal to the program, such as a global variable or heap-allocated structure, since all threads of a process share the same address space.

## 2. Core Semaphore Concepts and Operations

### 2.1 How semaphore work

A semaphore is an integer maintained by the kernel, whose value is restricted to be **greater than or equal to zero**.

Various operations (i.e., system calls) can be performed on a semaphore, including the following:
  - Increase the current value of the semaphore by 1 using `sem_post()`.
  - Decrease the current value of the semaphore by 1 using `sem_wait()`.
  - Read the current value of the semaphore.

### 2.2 Waiting on semaphore

```c
int sem_wait(sem_t *sem);
```

`sem_wait()` is used to decrement (or "lock") a semaphore.

If the semaphore's value is greater than 0, it decrements the value by 1 and continues.

If the value is 0, the function blocks (waits) until the semaphore becomes greater than 0.

This is how it controls access to a shared resource, ensuring that only a limited number of processes/threads can access the critical section at once.

```c
int sem_trywait(sem_t *sem);
```

`sem_trywait()` is a non-blocking version of `sem_wait()`.

It tries to decrement the semaphore immediately.

If the value is > 0, it decrements the value and proceeds.

If the value is 0, it returns immediately with an error, instead of blocking.

**Use Case**

Use `sem_trywait()` when you don’t want your thread/process to block if the resource is busy.

```c
int sem_timedwait(sem_t *sem, const struct timespec *abs_timeout);
```

**Purpose:**

`sem_timedwait()` blocks (like `sem_wait()`), but only up to a specified timeout.

If the semaphore becomes available before the timeout, it decrements the value and continues.

If the timeout expires, it returns with an error (ETIMEDOUT).

Prevents indefinite blocking.

**Comparision of 3 function**

| Feature                    | `sem_wait()`                                      | `sem_trywait()`                                 | `sem_timedwait()`                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blocking**               | ✅ Yes (blocks indefinitely)                       | ❌ No (non-blocking)                             | ✅ Yes (but with a time limit)                                 |
| **Timeout support**        | ❌ No                                              | ❌ No                                            | ✅ Yes (uses absolute time)                                    |
| **When it fails**          | Only on error (e.g., invalid semaphore)           | If value is 0, returns immediately              | If timeout expires or error occurs                            |
| **Typical `errno`**        | `EINTR`, `EINVAL`                                 | `EAGAIN`, `EINVAL`                              | `ETIMEDOUT`, `EINTR`, `EINVAL`                                |
| **Use case**               | You want to wait until the semaphore is available | You want to check availability without blocking | You want to wait for the resource but only up to a time limit |
| **Return value (success)** | `0`                                               | `0`                                             | `0`                                                           |
| **Return value (failure)** | `-1` with `errno` set                             | `-1` with `errno` set                           | `-1` with `errno` set                                         |
| **Real-time safe?**        | ❌ Can block indefinitely                          | ✅ Preferred for RT when fallback needed         | ✅ Useful in RT with predictable time budget                   |

**Summary:**
  - Use `sem_wait()`: When you’re okay waiting as long as needed.
  - Use `sem_trywait()`: When you want to avoid blocking (e.g., in a GUI, real-time system).
  - Use `sem_timedwait()`: When you need a timeout-safe wait with a fallback strategy.

### 2.3 Posting on semaphore

```c
int sem_post(sem_t *sem);
```

The sem_post() function increases (increases by 1) the value of the semaphore.

If the value of the semaphore is 0, then increase the value of the semaphore value by 1. Then the processes waiting for sem_wait() will be awakened.

If there are many processes waiting, the kernel uses the round-robin, time-sharing algorithm to decide.

That is, the process that waits first will not be executed first, but after sem_post(), the process that is the next time slot (time slice) of the CPU will be executed.

### 2.4 Read semaphore value 

```c
int sem_getvalue(sem_t *sem, int *sval);
```

It stores the current value of the semaphore in `*sval`.

If no threads are waiting, `*sval` reflects the actual count.

If threads are blocked in `sem_wait()`, `*sval` may be zero or negative (depending on the implementation).

**Caution:** The retrieved value might be outdated immediately after the call returns due to actions by other processes/threads. It's mainly useful for debugging or specific scenarios, not usually for synchronization logic itself.

## 3. System V Semaphores

System V semaphores are more complex than POSIX ones. They operate on **sets** of semaphores, identified by a system-wide integer ID (`semid`). Even if you only need one semaphore, you work with a set containing one member.

### 3.1. Overview

*   **Semaphore Sets:** A single `semid` refers to an array (set) of one or more semaphores. Each semaphore within the set is accessed by its index (starting from 0).
*   **Kernel Persistence:** Semaphore sets persist in the kernel even after the creating process exits, until explicitly removed using `semctl` with `IPC_RMID`.
*   **Identifiers:** Similar to System V Shared Memory, a `key_t` (often generated using `ftok()`) is used with `semget()` to obtain the `semid`.

### 3.2. Getting a Semaphore Set ID (`semget`)

`semget()` creates a new semaphore set or gets the ID of an existing one.

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/sem.h>

int semget(key_t key, int nsems, int semflg);
// Returns semid on success, -1 on error.
```

*   `key`: The `key_t` (e.g., from `ftok()`, or `IPC_PRIVATE`).
*   `nsems`: The number of semaphores in the set. **Required** when creating (`IPC_CREAT`). If getting an existing set ID, `nsems` can be 0 (or should match the existing set size, behavior varies).
*   `semflg`: Flags and permissions (bitwise OR):
    *   `IPC_CREAT`: Create the set if it doesn't exist.
    *   `IPC_EXCL`: Used with `IPC_CREAT`, fails if the set already exists.
    *   Permissions (e.g., `0666`): Control read/alter access to the semaphore set.

### 3.3. Semaphore Control Operations (`semctl`)

`semctl()` performs various control operations on the semaphore set or individual semaphores within it.

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/sem.h>

// Definition might require _GNU_SOURCE or similar on some systems
union semun {
    int              val;    /* Value for SETVAL */
    struct semid_ds *buf;    /* Buffer for IPC_STAT, IPC_SET */
    unsigned short  *array;  /* Array for GETALL, SETALL */
    struct seminfo  *__buf;  /* Buffer for IPC_INFO (Linux-specific) */
};

int semctl(int semid, int semnum, int cmd, ... /* union semun arg */);
// Return value depends on cmd; typically 0 or a non-negative value on success, -1 on error.
```

*   `semid`: The semaphore set identifier from `semget()`.
*   `semnum`: The index of the semaphore within the set (0 to `nsems`-1) to operate on. Ignored by some commands that apply to the whole set.
*   `cmd`: The command to perform. Common commands:
    *   `SETVAL`: Sets the value of the single semaphore `semnum` to `arg.val`. **Crucial for initialization.**
    *   `GETVAL`: Returns the value of the single semaphore `semnum`.
    *   `SETALL`: Sets the values of all semaphores in the set from the array `arg.array`. Requires alter permission.
    *   `GETALL`: Gets the values of all semaphores into the array `arg.array`. Requires read permission.
    *   `IPC_STAT`: Gets the `semid_ds` structure (metadata) for the set into `arg.buf`. Requires read permission.
    *   `IPC_SET`: Sets permission-related fields of the `semid_ds` structure from `arg.buf`. Requires owner privileges.
    *   `IPC_RMID`: Marks the semaphore set for removal. The set is destroyed once the last process using it terminates or detaches. Requires owner privileges. This is the standard way to clean up System V semaphores.
*   `arg` (The fourth argument of type `union semun`): Its value/type depends on the `cmd`. **Note:** You often need to declare `union semun` yourself as it's not always defined in headers.

### 3.4. Semaphore Operations (`semop`)

`semop()` is the workhorse function for performing atomic Wait (P) and Post (V) operations on **one or more** semaphores within a set simultaneously.

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/sem.h>

struct sembuf {
    unsigned short sem_num;  /* Semaphore index in set (0, 1, ...) */
    short          sem_op;   /* Operation value */
    short          sem_flg;  /* Operation flags (e.g., IPC_NOWAIT, SEM_UNDO) */
};

int semop(int semid, struct sembuf *sops, size_t nsops);
// Returns 0 on success, -1 on error.
```

*   `semid`: The semaphore set identifier.
*   `sops`: A pointer to an array of `sembuf` structures. Each structure specifies one operation on one semaphore in the set.
*   `nsops`: The number of `sembuf` structures in the `sops` array.

**The `sembuf` structure:**

*   `sem_num`: Index of the semaphore within the set to operate on.
*   `sem_op`: The operation value:
    *   **Positive Value (`> 0`):** Increment (Post/V). Adds `sem_op` to the semaphore's value. Always proceeds immediately (never blocks). Useful for releasing multiple resources at once.
    *   **Negative Value (`< 0`):** Decrement (Wait/P). Attempts to subtract `abs(sem_op)` from the semaphore's value.
        *   If `semval >= abs(sem_op)`, the subtraction occurs, and the operation completes.
        *   If `semval < abs(sem_op)`, the operation blocks (unless `IPC_NOWAIT` is set) until the value increases sufficiently.
    *   **Zero Value (`== 0`):** Wait-for-zero. Blocks (unless `IPC_NOWAIT` is set) until the semaphore's value becomes exactly 0. Then proceeds without changing the value. Useful for waiting until a resource pool is completely free.
*   `sem_flg`: Flags:
    *   `IPC_NOWAIT`: If the operation would block, `semop` returns immediately with `errno` set to `EAGAIN`.
    *   `SEM_UNDO`: **Very Important!** If set, the kernel automatically reverses the effect of `sem_op` on this semaphore if the process terminates unexpectedly (e.g., crashes) before explicitly undoing the operation. This helps prevent resources from being permanently locked if a process holding a semaphore dies. Essential for robust mutex implementation.

**Atomicity:** All operations defined in the `sops` array (up to `nsops`) are performed **atomically** as a single unit. Either all succeed, or if any single operation would block (and `IPC_NOWAIT` is not set), the process blocks *before any* of the operations are applied. If any operation fails (e.g., permission error), none are applied.

### 3.5. System V Semaphore Example (Mutual Exclusion for Shared Counter)

This example uses a System V semaphore set (with one semaphore) as a mutex to protect access to a counter stored in System V shared memory.

**common_sysv.h:**

```c
#ifndef COMMON_SYSV_H
#define COMMON_SYSV_H

#include <sys/types.h>

#define SHM_KEY_PATH "/tmp/sysv_shm_key"
#define SEM_KEY_PATH "/tmp/sysv_sem_key"
#define PROJECT_ID 'X'
#define SHM_SIZE 1024

// Key for shared memory and semaphore set
key_t shm_key;
key_t sem_key;

// IDs
int shmid;
int semid;

// Pointer to shared memory
int *shared_counter;

// semop structures
struct sembuf wait_op = {0, -1, SEM_UNDO}; // Wait (P) on semaphore 0
struct sembuf post_op = {0, 1, SEM_UNDO};  // Post (V) on semaphore 0

// Required for semctl
union semun {
    int val;
    struct semid_ds *buf;
    unsigned short *array;

**How to Compile and Run System V Example:**

1.  Save the code: `common_sysv.h`, `shm_sem_writer_sysv.c`, `shm_sem_reader_sysv.c`.
2.  Create dummy files for `ftok`:
    ```bash
    touch /tmp/sysv_shm_key
    touch /tmp/sysv_sem_key
    ```
3.  Compile:
    ```bash
    gcc shm_sem_writer_sysv.c -o writer_sysv
    gcc shm_sem_reader_sysv.c -o reader_sysv
    ```
4.  Run (in separate terminals, potentially multiple instances):
    ```bash
    ./writer_sysv 10 # Run writer to increment 10 times (will initialize first time)
    ./reader_sysv 5  # Run reader to decrement 5 times
    ./writer_sysv 3  # Run another writer
    # ... etc.
    ```
5.  **Cleanup:** After finishing, manually remove the IPC objects (since the example code doesn't reliably do it):
    ```bash
    ipcrm -S $(ftok /tmp/sysv_sem_key X) # Remove semaphore set
    ipcrm -M $(ftok /tmp/sysv_shm_key X) # Remove shared memory segment
    # Or use ipcs to find IDs and ipcrm -s <semid> / ipcrm -m <shmid>
    ```
