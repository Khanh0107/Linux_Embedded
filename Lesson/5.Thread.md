# Thread
---
## 1. Overview 

Threads are execution units within a process that enable concurrent task execution. Similar to processes, threads allow multi-tasking but with lower overhead in memory and CPU usage. In a multi-core system, multiple threads can run in parallel, improving performance. If one thread is blocked, others can continue executing independently.


**Benefits:**

Concurrency: Perform multiple tasks at once (e.g., downloading while updating UI).
Responsiveness: UI remains responsive while background work runs.
Performance: On multi-core CPUs, threads can run in parallel.

--- 

## 2. Principle of operation

Similar to processes, threads are created for the purpose of handling multiple tasks at the same time (multi-task).

- A thread is a lightweight process that can be managed independently by a scheduler.
- On a multi-core system. Multiple threads can run in parallel.
- If one thread is blocked, the other threads can continue to run normally.
- Each time a thread is created, it is placed in a stack segment.

**Context Switching** 

The CPU switches between threads, allowing multiple tasks to proceed concurrently. This involves saving and restoring thread states, leading to some overhead.

---

## 3. Compare Process with Thread

**Thread Switching**

Thread switching is a type of context switching from one thread to another thread in the same process.

Thread switching is very efficient and much cheaper because it involves switching out only identities and resources such as the program counter, registers and stack pointers. 

The cost of thread-to-thread switching is about the same as the cost of entering and exiting the kernel.

**Process Switching**

Process switching is a type of context switching where we switch one process with another process. 

 It involves switching of all the process resources with those needed by a new process. 
 
This means switching the memory address space. This includes memory addresses, page tables, and kernel resources, caches in the processor. 

| **Aspect**            | **Thread**                                                            | **Process**                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**        | Smallest unit of execution within a process                           | Independent program in execution                                        |
| **Memory**            | Shares memory space with other threads of the same process            | Has its own separate memory space                                       |
| **Communication**     | Faster – via shared memory (no IPC needed)                            | Slower – requires Inter-Process Communication (IPC) like pipes, sockets |
| **Creation Overhead** | Low – faster to create                                                | High – more resources and time needed                                   |
| **Context Switching** | Faster – less overhead (threads share resources)                      | Slower – involves switching entire memory context                       |
| **Crash Impact**      | If one thread crashes, it can affect the whole process                | If a process crashes, other processes are usually unaffected            |
| **Control**           | Controlled by the parent process                                      | Managed independently by the OS                                         |
| **Use Case**          | Lightweight tasks within the same app (e.g. UI thread, worker thread) | Independent apps (e.g. Chrome, Word, Calculator)                        |

## 4. Working with thread

### 4.1 Thread ID

A process is identified by a process ID, a thread within a process is identified by a thread ID. 

- A process ID is unique across the system, whereas a thread ID is unique within a process. 
- A process ID is an integer value, but a thread ID does not have to be an integer value. It can be a structure. 
- A process ID can be printed very easily, whereas a thread ID cannot.

Thread ID will be represented by the type `pthread_t`. 

In most cases thread ID will be a structure so to compare two thread IDs we need a function that can do this job (For process ID is an integer, the comparison is simpler). 

To do this we use the following two functions: `pthread_self()` and `pthread_equal()`

- `pthread_self()`: Retrieves the calling thread's ID.
  
- `pthread_equal()`: Compares two thread IDs.

### 4.2 Create thread 

`int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine)(void *),void *arg);`

| **Parameter**                    | **Description**                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pthread_t *thread`              | Output: stores the **ID** of the newly created thread.                                                     |
| `const pthread_attr_t *attr`     | Optional. If `NULL`, default attributes are used (joinable, etc.). Otherwise, custom thread attributes.    |
| `void *(*start_routine)(void *)` | Function pointer – the **function the new thread will run**. It must take a `void *` and return `void *`.  |
| `void *arg`                      | Argument passed to `start_routine`. Can be `NULL` or a pointer to any data you want to pass to the thread. |


`pthread_join()` 

Waits for a specific thread to finish.

It blocks the calling thread until the target thread terminates.

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pthread_t thread` | The thread ID (returned from `pthread_create()`) that you want to wait for.                                   |
| `void **retval`    | A pointer to a `void*` where the return value from the thread will be stored. If you don’t care, pass `NULL`. |

**Code demo**

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
void *thread_function(void *arg) {
    pthread_t tid = pthread_self();
    printf("Thread ID: %lu\n", (unsigned long)tid);
    return NULL;
}
int main() {
    pthread_t thread1, thread2;
    pthread_create(&thread1, NULL, thread_function, NULL);
    pthread_create(&thread2, NULL, thread_function, NULL);
    pthread_join(thread1, NULL);
    pthread_join(thread2, NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```sh
Thread ID: 130023310751296
Thread ID: 130023302358592
```

### 4.3 Thread management
---

#### 4.3.1 `int pthread_exit(void *retval);`


A thread can be terminated by calling `pthread_exit()`. 

**Arguments: **

- *retval: Specifies the return value of the thread, which can be obtained by another thread via `pthread_join()`. 

- Returns 0 on success, less than 0 on failure.

---

#### 4.3.2 int pthread_cancel(pthread_t thread);


`pthread_cancel()` sends a thread termination request to a specified thread.

**Arguments:**

- thread: the threadID of the specified thread.

- Returns 0 on success, less than 0 on failure.

**Thread termination methods**

| Method                      | Description                       | Return Value Accessible  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `return`                    | Normal exit from thread function  | Yes (via `pthread_join`) |
| `pthread_exit()`            | Graceful exit with a return value | Yes                      |
| `pthread_cancel()`          | Asks another thread to stop       | Depends on cancel state  |
| `exit()` or end of `main()` | Ends all threads                  | No                       |

---

#### 4.3.3 Joinable thread 

To get the end value of another thread we use `pthread_join()`.

`int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);`

`pthread_join()` will block until a thread terminates (threadID is passed in the thread argument). If the thread has terminated, pthread_join returns immediately. 

When the thread terminates, it is basically treated as a zombie process. If the number of zombie threads increases. At some point, we will not be able to create more threads. The role of `pthread_join()` is similar to `waitpid()`.

---

#### 4.3.4 Detaching thread

By default, a thread is joinable, meaning that when a thread terminates, another thread can obtain the return value of that thread via `pthread_join()`.

However, in many cases we do not need to care about the termination state of the thread, but only need the system to automatically clean and remove the thread.

In this case, we can put the thread into detached state by calling `pthread_detached()`.

`int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);`

Once a thread is detached, we cannot use pthread_join() to obtain the thread's termination status, and the thread cannot return to the joinable state.

**Arguments:**

- thread: ThreadID of the specified thread.

- Returns 0 on success, less than 0 on failure.

## 5. Theard synchronization

---

### 5.1 Synchronization issues

- Race condition: Occurs when multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization (atomic and nonatomic).
  
- Deadlock: Occurs when multiple threads wait for each other to release resources, causing indefinite blocking.
  
- Critical Section: A section of code that must be executed by only one thread at a time to prevent race conditions.

---

### 5.2 Mutex (mutual exclusion)

Mutex (mutual exclusion) is a technique used to ensure that only one thread has access to shared resources at a time.

Mutex implementation generally involves three steps:

- Initialize mutex lock
- Implement mutex lock for shared resources before entering critical section.
- Implement access to shared resources.
- Unlock/release mutex lock.

Allocate Mutexs

The mutex lock is a variable of type pthread_mutex_t. Before using it, we must always initialize the mutex lock.

The mutex lock can be allocated statically or dynamically

```c
pthread_mutex_t mtx = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex, const pthread_mutexattr_t *attr);
```

When not in use, we must destroy the mutex with pthread_mutex_destroy(). Static initialization does not require calling this function.

---

### 5.3 Locking and Unlocking a Mutex

After initialization, the mutex lock falls into the unlocked state. 

To lock or unlock a mutex lock, we use two functions pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock().

`int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);`

When the mutex lock is unlocked, pthread_mutex_lock() returns immediately. Conversely, if the mutex is locked by another thread, pthread_mutex_lock() blocks until the mutex is unlocked.

**Arguments:**

- *mutex: Pointer to the mutex lock
- Returns 0 on success, less than 0 on failure.

`int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);`

Unlock a mutex lock.

**Arguments:**

- *mutex: Pointer to mutex lock
- Returns 0 on success, less than 0 on failure.

**Code demo**

```c
/* mutex_demo.c: increment a shared counter safely with a mutex */
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define NUM_THREADS   4
#define NUM_INCREMENTS 1000000

long long counter = 0;                  /* shared resource            */
pthread_mutex_t counter_lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void *worker(void *arg)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_INCREMENTS; ++i) {
        /* --- CRITICAL SECTION START --- */
        pthread_mutex_lock(&counter_lock);   // 1️⃣ LOCK
        counter++;                           // update shared data
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&counter_lock); // 2️⃣ UNLOCK
        /* ---  CRITICAL SECTION END  --- */
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main(void)
{
    pthread_t tids[NUM_THREADS];

    /* create threads */
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; ++i)
        pthread_create(&tids[i], NULL, worker, NULL);

    /* wait for threads to finish */
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; ++i)
        pthread_join(tids[i], NULL);

    printf("Expected value: %lld\n", (long long)NUM_THREADS * NUM_INCREMENTS);
    printf("Final counter : %lld\n", counter);

    pthread_mutex_destroy(&counter_lock);
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```sh
Expected value: 4000000
Final counter : 4000000
```

### 5.4 Condition variables

A **Condition Variable** is a synchronization mechanism in multithreading that allows threads to communicate with each other based on specific conditions. Condition Variables are often used in combination with **Mutexes** to control access to shared resources.
#### Why?
- In a multithreading application, when a thread needs to wait for a certain condition (e.g., a resource becoming available), it can block without consuming CPU resources.
- Condition Variables allow a thread to **wait** until it receives a **signal** from another thread indicating that the condition has been met.
#### Condition Variables and Mutexes
- **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)** ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
- **Condition Variables** notify waiting threads about changes in shared resources and allow blocked threads to resume execution.
#### How it works:
- A thread **waits** on a Condition Variable if the required condition is not met.
- Another thread modifies the shared resource and **signals** the waiting thread to continue execution.
#### Allocating and Initializing Condition Variables
In Linux, a Condition Variable is defined using `pthread_cond_t`. Before using it, it must be initialized in one of two ways:
- **Static allocation:**
    ```c
    pthread_cond_t cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
    ```
- **Dynamic allocation:**
    ```c
    int pthread_cond_init(pthread_cond_t *cond, const pthread_condattr_t *attr);
    ```

#### Destroying a Condition Variable
- When no longer needed, a dynamically allocated Condition Variable should be destroyed using:
    ```c
    pthread_cond_destroy(&cond);
    ```
- If using static initialization (`PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER`), calling `pthread_cond_destroy()` is not required.
#### Using Condition Variables for Signaling and Waiting
Condition Variables support two main operations:
- **Signal:** Notifies a waiting thread that the condition has been met.
- **Wait:** Blocks the thread until the condition is satisfied.
##### Example:
```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_cond_t cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
int shared_data = 0;

void *producer(void *arg) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    shared_data = 1; // Update shared data
    pthread_cond_signal(&cond); // Notify consumer
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    return NULL;
}

void *consumer(void *arg) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    while (shared_data == 0) {
        pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex); // Wait for signal from producer amd release mutex
    }
    printf("Consumer: Received data!\n");
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t t1, t2;
    pthread_create(&t1, NULL, consumer, NULL);
    pthread_create(&t2, NULL, producer, NULL);
    pthread_join(t1, NULL);
    pthread_join(t2, NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

##### Explanation of the Code
- The `producer()` function updates `shared_data` and sends a signal using `pthread_cond_signal()`.
- The `consumer()` function checks `shared_data`, and if it's not ready, it calls `pthread_cond_wait()`.
- When `pthread_cond_signal()` is called, the blocked `pthread_cond_wait()` exits, allowing the consumer to continue execution.

### Bonus
Mutex and `pthread_cond_signal()` (or `pthread_cond_broadcast()`) are often used together in multithreading to ensure synchronization when using **condition variables**.
#### 🔥 Main Reason: Preventing Race Conditions When Checking a Condition
- **Condition variables** allow a thread to wait for a specific condition to occur.
- However, **this condition is usually related to shared data**, and if multiple threads access the data simultaneously without a mutex, a **race condition** can occur.
- A mutex helps **protect shared data**, ensuring that when one thread modifies the state of the data, **no other thread reads or writes to it at the same time**.
#### 🛠 How Mutex and Condition Variables Work Together

##### 1️⃣ When a Thread Waits for a Condition (`pthread_cond_wait`)
🔹 **The mutex protects the data before waiting**  
🔹 **`pthread_cond_wait()` automatically**:

- **Releases the mutex** so that other threads can modify the data.
- **Blocks (sleeps) until it receives a signal (`pthread_cond_signal()`) from another thread**.
- Once woken up, `pthread_cond_wait()` **automatically reacquires the mutex** to continue execution safely.

```c
pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
while (condition == false) {
	pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex);  // Automatically releases mutex and waits 
}
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
```

##### 2️⃣ When a Thread Modifies Data and Sends a Signal (`pthread_cond_signal`)

🔹 **The mutex must be acquired before modifying the data**  
🔹 After modifying the data, send a signal using `pthread_cond_signal()`  
🔹 **Release the mutex so that the waiting thread can proceed**

```c
pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
condition = true;
pthread_cond_signal(&cond);  // Wakes up one waiting thread 
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
```

##### 🎯 Summary: Why Does Mutex Go Together with Condition Variables?

✅ **Protects shared data**: Prevents race conditions when reading/writing data.  
✅ **Ensures `pthread_cond_wait()` works correctly**: Automatically releases the mutex when waiting and reacquires it when continuing.  
✅ **Maintains proper synchronization between threads**: One thread can wait while another sends a signal without causing errors.

**💡 Not using a mutex can lead to race conditions, deadlocks, or wake-up misses (where a thread doesn’t receive the signal correctly).**
