# Thread
## 1. Overview 

Threads are execution units within a process that enable concurrent task execution. Similar to processes, threads allow multi-tasking but with lower overhead in memory and CPU usage. In a multi-core system, multiple threads can run in parallel, improving performance. If one thread is blocked, others can continue executing independently.


**Benefits:**

Concurrency: Perform multiple tasks at once (e.g., downloading while updating UI).

Responsiveness: UI remains responsive while background work runs.

Performance: On multi-core CPUs, threads can run in parallel.

## Principle of operation

Similar to processes, threads are created for the purpose of handling multiple tasks at the same time (multi-task).

- A thread is a lightweight process that can be managed independently by a scheduler.
- On a multi-core system. Multiple threads can run in parallel.
- If one thread is blocked, the other threads can continue to run normally.
- Each time a thread is created, it is placed in a stack segment.
