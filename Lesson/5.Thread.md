# Thread
---
## 1. Overview 

Threads are execution units within a process that enable concurrent task execution. Similar to processes, threads allow multi-tasking but with lower overhead in memory and CPU usage. In a multi-core system, multiple threads can run in parallel, improving performance. If one thread is blocked, others can continue executing independently.


**Benefits:**

Concurrency: Perform multiple tasks at once (e.g., downloading while updating UI).
Responsiveness: UI remains responsive while background work runs.
Performance: On multi-core CPUs, threads can run in parallel.

## 2. Principle of operation

Similar to processes, threads are created for the purpose of handling multiple tasks at the same time (multi-task).

- A thread is a lightweight process that can be managed independently by a scheduler.
- On a multi-core system. Multiple threads can run in parallel.
- If one thread is blocked, the other threads can continue to run normally.
- Each time a thread is created, it is placed in a stack segment.

**Context Switching** 

The CPU switches between threads, allowing multiple tasks to proceed concurrently. This involves saving and restoring thread states, leading to some overhead.

## Compare Process with Thread

**Thread Switching**

Thread switching is a type of context switching from one thread to another thread in the same process.
Thread switching is very efficient and much cheaper because it involves switching out only identities and resources such as the program counter, registers and stack pointers. 
The cost of thread-to-thread switching is about the same as the cost of entering and exiting the kernel.

**Process Switching**

Process switching is a type of context switching where we switch one process with another process. 
 It involves switching of all the process resources with those needed by a new process. 
This means switching the memory address space. This includes memory addresses, page tables, and kernel resources, caches in the processor.
